      <dt>Why Python?</dt>
      <dd>Python has many open-source libraries and tools that make doing certain tasks and working with data much easier than trying to do them in JavaScript. Luckily, once you learn the basics of one high level programming language, it is not too difficult to code in a new language. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>Pandas</dt>
      <dd>Provides the basis for manipulating tabular data. Pandas' data manipulation capabilities are built on top of NumPy, which is a library for efficient array computations. Matplotlib is for graphing and visualization of this data. These libraries provide the basis for exploratory data analysis.</dd>

      <dd>A Python module for automation and programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard.</dd>

      <dt>Beautiful soup</dt>
      <dd>The Beautiful Soup module is used for web scraping. It parses data that is received from the Requests modules. </dd>
