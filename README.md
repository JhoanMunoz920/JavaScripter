# Learn MERN stack hacks

## 🤔 Why?

I started a bootcamp at the University of Miami and wanted to have an organized repository of diagrams, references, and cheatsheets to reference whenever I forgot how something worked. The bootcamp focused on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) so the materials organized in this repository will be primarily focused on this stack.
