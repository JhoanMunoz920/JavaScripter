# MERN stack diagrams and cheatsheets

## 🤔 Why?

I started a bootcamp at the University of Miami and wanted to have an organized repository of diagrams, references, and cheatsheets to help guide me along the process of becoming a full stack developer. The bootcamp focused on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) so the materials organized in this repo will be primarily focused on this stack.
